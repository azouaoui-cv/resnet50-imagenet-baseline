# resnet50-imagenet-baseline
Image classification baseline using ResNet50 on ImageNet

## Goal

Iâ€™m currently interested in reproducing some baseline image classification results using PyTorch.
My goal is to get a `resnet50` model to have a test accuracy as close as the one reported in torchvision [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/models.html) (**76.15** top 1 accuracy on the official validation set)

In order to do that, I closely follow the setup from the official PyTorch examples [repository](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py)

However I notice a big gap since I'm only able to obtain **73.12** top 1 accuracy.

This repository is here for reproducibility purposes.
The related PyTorch forums post can be found [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/testing-accuracy-gap-when-training-a-resnet50-on-imagenet-from-scratch/110611)

## Installation

---

The code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.7.9

```
$ git clone git@github.com:inzouzouwetrust/resnet50-imagenet-baseline.git
$ cd resnet50-imagenet-baseline && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a data folder and soft link it to where your ImageNet data is located:

```
$ mkdir data
$ ln -s /path/your/imagenet/root $PWD/data/ImageNet
```

## Usage

---

**WARNING**: Make sure to have 4 GPUs with 32Gb per GPU on a single node to use DDP.

To train a resnet50 model on ImageNet following [this](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py) simple setup, use:

```
$ python train.py
```

**NOTE**: The training takes around 1 day when using the proposed setup on 4 Tesla V100 GPUs.

To test the model that you have trained on a specific datetime:

```
$ python inference.py test.checkpoint=data/runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS
```
